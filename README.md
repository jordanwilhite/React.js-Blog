#This is the README for 8-20-15

So, for this homework assignment, we had two goals:

#1)Write a blog post about what we learned about React.js
#2)Use a jQuery pluging from unheap.com and play around with it.

Here is the link to my React.js Blog: https://jordanwilhite.wordpress.com/2015/08/20/how-should-i-react-js/
